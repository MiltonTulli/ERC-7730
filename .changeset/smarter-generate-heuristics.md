`generateDescriptor()` now emits a draft ERC-7730 v2 file with ABI heuristics (`tokenAmount` + `@.to` on ERC-20, `date` timestamps, `addressName`, Solidity `metadata.enums`) and a TODO `$comment`. Output validates as v2 and is never a high-confidence runtime source. Authors still need to edit intents before an official-registry PR.
